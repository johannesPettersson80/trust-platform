This report separates one validated measured pilot from five planned focused
shards. It creates no proof, invariant coverage, spec-gap closure, release
evidence, product behavior, or CI enforcement change.

## Summary

- Shards: 6
- Measured shards: 1
- Planned shards: 5
- Defined mutants: 7
- Measured mutants: 2
- Caught: 2
- Survived: 0
- Unviable: 0
- Timeout: 0
- Error: 0
- Coverage runs: 0

## Shards

## Outcomes

| Shard | Mutant | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MUTATION_SHARD_BYTECODE_VALIDATOR_001` | `MUTANT_VALIDATE_INSTRUCTION_STREAM_BYPASS` | `caught` |
| `MUTATION_SHARD_BYTECODE_VALIDATOR_001` | `MUTANT_VALIDATE_STACK_SHAPE_BYPASS` | `caught` |

## Survivors

No survivors are present in the measured pilot.

## Boundaries

- `report_creates_proof`: `false`
- `report_creates_invariant_coverage`: `false`
- `report_closes_spec_gaps`: `false`
- `report_is_release_evidence`: `false`
- `new_mutation_or_coverage_run_executed_by_report`: `false`
- `runtime_or_product_behavior_changed`: `false`
- `ci_enforcement_changed`: `false`

## Limitations

- Only the existing bytecode-validator pilot is measured; five other focused shards are definitions with empty result arrays.
- Cargo-mutants single-file listing resolves each selector but does not execute a baseline, build, test, mutation, or coverage command.
- Caught and survived are derived from raw build/test exit and timeout fields; infrastructure failures are errors and cannot count as caught or unviable.
- Associated scanner and case identities are traceability labels, not claims that a specific test or blocked case killed a mutant.
- Mutation and coverage results are test-adequacy signals, never release safety proof, invariant coverage, or spec-gap closure.
- A future measured connector-projection shard must bind a delivered artifact SHA-256 and direct execution confirmation.
- The implementation board is checked live but excluded from the digest because board and evidence closure follow report generation.
